# Chat!

Welcome to this experimental Github repository for my live chat application. This chat app supports multiple themes, offering users the ability to customize the look and feel of the interface. Additionally, the application is designed to operate without JavaScript, ensuring that it is accessible to a broader range of users. To create a dynamic and responsive user interface, I have utilized conditional rendering techniques, including @if and @foreach. This repository is a valuable resource for those seeking to learn about web development or looking for a reliable chat application. Your feedback and contributions are most welcome. Thank you for visiting.
